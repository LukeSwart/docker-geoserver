# Docker Geoserver

This project is essentially a fork of: https://github.com/kartoza/docker-geoserver
Much thanks to the Kartoza org for setting this up.

This project adds a little more on top of that container to better suite our needs. We have added a docker solution using docker-compose that adds HTTPs to the deployment. We are also planning to add the ability to synce to an S3 bucket using Basic Auth.


## Other configurations:

Check out the branch `geoexplorer` to use geoserver with the geoexplorer plugin.
